# Overview üìë

Movie-Buzz allows users to order tickets for a show and gather information about movies and venues. To purchase show tickets, the customer must first register to the application. When selecting a show, the user is presented with a seating configuration from which he can select seats. He'll be redirected to the payment input screen.
After completing the payment a ticket mail will be sent to the user email address with ticket details.
The suggested application allows users to reserve a movie from a theatre for a specific date & time. The user can display their booking history as a theatre ticket, saving time.
